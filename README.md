# med-jargon-explain-inator

BEHOLD! THE MED-JARGON-EXPLAIN-INATOR! With this I will get rid of all pedantic and overly indulgent usage of jargon in the TRI-STATE AREA, thereby increasing MEDICAL LITERACY for all!! 🎉

## 📆 Schedule 📆
4/25
- Low-fidelity design for UX using figma and/or swagger.
- Create a UX design questionnaire based on the design.

5/2
- Fill out the questionnaire x 3 times with user hat on.
- Create a 1-page report to summarize the results and make recommendations for a more inclusive UX design.

## Setup
TBD, but you'll need at least Python 3.6. Install by using `pip <package name>`. Python packages needed are listed here:
- `nltk`
- `fastapi`
- `"uvicorn[standard]"`

## Structure
The explain-inator is built using a traditional [Model-View-Controller](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvc-framework-introduction/) framework. See the READMEs inside each folder to see more details about how this all works together.

## Running the app
Run `uvicorn main:app --reload` in your terminal. Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and you should see the Hello World! message.
Navigating to `127.0.0.1:8000/docs` will give you the OpenAPI documentation for all the REST routes we currently have.

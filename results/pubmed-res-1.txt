# Source texts (first paragraph from the article Formate assay in body fluids: Application in methanol poisoning):
(* The availability of a sensitive and specific assay for formic acid
remains one of the limiting factors in our understanding of its role in the
toxicity of methanol in man and lower animals (1). A great deal of information has been generated on the oxidation of methanol in lower animals and in primates (2-5) and, recently, the disposition of formaldehyde in animals has been studied (6). However, little is known
concerning the disposition of formate in vivo in animals despite the relative wealth of information available on the metabolism of this substance
in vitro (7,8). This is due partly to the lack of a suitable assay for formate
in body fluids and tissues.  *)

Chemical: Formic acid, methanol, formaldehyde, and formate
Species: Man, animals, and primates
